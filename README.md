= MediaWiki CASAuth(entication) Extension =

The CASAuth extension facilitates CAS authentication for your Mediawiki installation.  The code derives from work by Ioannis Yessios and others, which can be found at http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:CASAuthentication

This code is customized towards usage for private wikis, with the ability to restrict access to the wiki to specific usernames.

This extension is currently written towards Mediawiki 1.16, however as the version in the EPEL repository changes, it will be modified to work with the latest available in the EPEL repository.
